> Written to think clearly. Not to be right.

I’m writing this without a point.

No argument.
No conclusion.
No intention to arrive anywhere.

This is just a marker.
A place where thinking started becoming visible.

If this file stays empty, that’s fine.
If it fills up later, also fine.

Nothing needs to happen here.
