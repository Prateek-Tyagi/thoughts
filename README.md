# thoughts

This repository is a place to write things down.

No audience.
No optimization.
No goal to explain or convince.

Just thoughts, written as they are, for clarity and memory.

---

## How this is used

- Each file is a single idea or reflection.
- Writing is informal and unpolished.
- Files are written primarily for myself.
- Public by default, but not performative.

---

## Structure

- `writing/`  
  Finished or complete-enough thoughts.

- `drafts/`  
  Incomplete, messy, or ongoing ideas.

---

## Rules

- Write honestly.
- No rewriting to sound smart.
- No deleting old thoughts because they feel wrong later.
- No pressure to be consistent.

---

## Why this exists

Some thoughts need to be written, not shared.
This is where they go.
